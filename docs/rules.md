# March Madness Investment Pool Rules

## Overview
The March Madness Investment Pool (Calcutta) is an alternative to traditional bracket pools where players invest virtual currency in teams through a blind auction system. Players earn points based on their owned teams' performance in the tournament.

## Basic Structure
- Each player starts with $100 in virtual currency
- Players bid on teams before the tournament begins
- Ownership of teams is proportional to investment
- Points are earned through team performance in the tournament

## Bidding Rules
1. All bids are sealed until the tournament begins
2. Players must bid on a minimum of 3 teams
3. Players may bid on a maximum of 10 teams
4. Maximum bid on any single team is $50
5. Total bids cannot exceed starting budget of $100
6. Minimum bid on any team is $1
7. Ownership percentage = (Player's bid on team) ÷ (Total bids on team)
8. All bids become public once the tournament begins

## Scoring System
Teams earn cumulative points for advancing in the tournament:
1. First Round Win: 50 points
2. Sweet 16 Appearance: +100 points
3. Elite 8 Appearance: +150 points
4. Final Four Appearance: +200 points
5. Championship Game Appearance: +250 points
6. Tournament Winner: +300 points

Maximum possible points for a team: 1,050 points

## Winner Determination
- Players earn points based on their ownership percentage of each team
- Example: 10% ownership of the tournament winner = 105 points
- The player with the most total points at the end of the tournament wins
- Ties are possible and allowed under the rules
- If a team receives no bids, their points are not awarded to any player

## Timeline
1. Bidding opens: [TBD]

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Bid & Ownership
Consider Team A receives the following bids:
- Player 1: $20
- Player 2: $30
- Player 3: $50

Total investment in Team A: $100
Ownership breakdown:
- Player 1: 20% (20/100)
- Player 2: 30% (30/100)
- Player 3: 50% (50/100)

If Team A wins their first two games (making Sweet 16), they earn 150 points:
- Player 1 earns: 30 points (20% of 150)
- Player 2 earns: 45 points (30% of 150)
- Player 3 earns: 75 points (50% of 150)

### Example 2: Multiple Team Investment
Player 1's portfolio:
- $50 on Duke (25% ownership)
- $30 on Kansas (15% ownership)
- $20 on Gonzaga (10% ownership)

Tournament results:
- Duke: Makes Final Four (500 points) → Player earns 125 points (25% of 500)
- Kansas: Loses first round (0 points) → Player earns 0 points
- Gonzaga: Makes Sweet 16 (150 points) → Player earns 15 points (10% of 150)

Player 1's total score: 140 points

### Example 3: No Bids Scenario
- Team B receives no bids
- Team B makes it to Elite 8 (300 points)
- No points are awarded to any player

### Example 4: Maximum Points Scenario

- Player 1: $40 (40% ownership)

Championship team wins tournament (1,050 total points):
- Player 1 earns: 420 points (40% of 1,050)
- Player 2 earns: 630 points (60% of 1,050)
